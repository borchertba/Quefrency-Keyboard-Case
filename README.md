# Quefrency Keyboard Case

***

I have gone through multiple iterations for this keyboard. The one I fully completed was revision 3. It was designed in just a day, so there might be errors, but so far it doesn't seem that bad. All of these designs were made specifically for my B-stock plate. So this won't work for anyone else unless you modify where the screw holes go. I might fix that later, but I'd need the dimensions.

## Hardware

The keyboard is made in a sandwich style, where the plate and clear piece are pressed between the top and bottom case parts. They are held together using M2x10mm screws that thread into threaded heat inserts on the top case. 

## 3D Printing

The case was printed on a Bambu P1S. The tolerances are set a 0.1mm and some sections are pretty thin. So be careful while printing and some sanding might be needed if your tolerances are bigger. The top of the case and the clear mid-section are made of PETG and the bottom is PLA. It really does not matter what materials you use, but that's just what I did.
