# Quefrency Keyboard Case

I have gone through multiple itterations for this keyboard. I made this specifically for my B-stock plate. So this won't work for anyone else unless you modify where the screw holes go. I have no idea the dimensions, but in the future I might modify it for anyone to use, if people care. The top of the case uses M2 threaded heat inserts and 10mm long M2 screws with washers.
